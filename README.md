# Market Simulator

This Python project's goal is to quickly generate
data that can be used to simulate a market. This is done 
by using randomness, so this data will be devoid of
patterns found in a real market setting.

Currently, this program only generates either a list of
(x, y) coordinates or a list of (high, low) tuples (used
to generate a "candle" in a candle graph).
